In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

##### We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.

##### Using blockchain technology, NEOS provides a direct link between data saved on the blockchain acting as an immutable distributed database and the client interface (frontend). Data is referenced by ID, which points to a location in the transaction database. Revisions of the data as well as their pointers can be updated to either reflect a current version or a pointer updated point to empty data in the event questionable or illicit content should be reported. Due to the nature of the technology being used and the implementation, however, data is permanent and cannot be removed without effectively shutting down the entire network and project.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act

##### CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

### According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:

* Users can visit the NEOS Network anonymously.

* We will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your
consent.

* All users of the NEOS Network may make any changes to their information at any time by logging into their control panel and going to the 'Edit Profile' page.

### COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

##### When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

##### We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. We do not let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13.

### Terms and Conditions

##### Please visit our Terms and Conditions section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of the NEOS Network.

### Fair Information Practices

##### The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

#### In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

##### We will notify the users via in-network notification

* Within 7 business days

#### If you provided us with your email, we will notify you via email
* Within 7 business days


##### We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
